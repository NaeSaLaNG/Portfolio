- <i>It's not a word.</i></font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, it is.
- <i>Really?</i></font>

267
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it is.</font>

268
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you google it?
- Doesn't matter.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What would Barry say?</i></font>

270
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Barry would say, "A negative outlook
leads to a negative outcome."</font>

271
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wow. How much do you pay him again?</i></font>

00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our job is to keep you safe</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lemon. Where's the briefcase?</font>

276
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I stashed it.</font>

277
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The case, Lemon.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a liability, you know?
To my father.</font>

280
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm?</font>

281
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't need a reason
to kill people like you.</font>

282
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needs a reason not to.</font>

283
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he have one?</font>

284
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,862
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fucking confusin'.</font>

285
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hello?
<i>- Do you have White Death's son?</i></font>

with the silly face tattoos?</font>

00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's sat right here.

291
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,676

292
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's not anymore.</font>

293
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to find
the person who took that case.</font>

294
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you're right.</font>

295
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe my luck is starting to turn.</font>

300
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You.</font>

301
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

302
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

303
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,935

304
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you came here to kill me.</font>

305
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents call me <i>malen'kiy prints.</i></font>

306
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means little prince.
Obviously, they wanted a boy.</font>

307
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to want
to hear the whole story.</font>

308
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or you'll be very, very sorry.</font>

309
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:16,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the hospital.</font>

310
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,419
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hang on.</font>

311
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Yes, you can see the boy now.</font>

312
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,265
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. If you don't hear from me
every 10 minutes</font>

313
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or if I don't answer this phone
when you call,</font>

314
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,609
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to go in there and kill...</font>

315
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, what's your boy's name again?</font>

316
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wataru.</font>

317
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,739
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Right.</font>

318
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kill Wataru.</font>

319
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aren't we glad we waited?</font>

320
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We got his son. That was our job.</i></font>

321
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our job was to come back
with his son and his $10 million.</font>

322
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,226
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 words describe
our situation right now.</font>

323
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you know what they are?
- Sure do. Saved... his... son. Hm?</font>

324
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Family's more important
than money, right?</font>

325
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you honestly not know
who the White Death is?</font>

326
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know the White Death.
You just told me 5 minutes ago.</font>

327
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,094
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do I even bother
forwarding you the briefings?</font>

328
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know.</font>

329
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Japanese underworld
used to be ruled by a man named Minegishi.</font>

330
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now, Minegishi was one brutal bastard.</i></font>

331
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But he was old-school, you know?</i></font>

332
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Tradition and loyalty
was all that mattered to him.</i></font>

333
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,771
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When you were in, you were in.
You were like family.</i></font>

334
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He treated you
like you were one of his own.</i></font>

335
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,547
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then out of the blue comes this
6-foot-fucking-6 geezer from Russia.</font>

336
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whispers that he was exiled from the
Russian mafia or that he was ex-KGB.</i></font>

337
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No one really knows the truth.</i></font>

338
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But what is known is this Russian</i></font>

339
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>worked his way up the ranks.</i></font>

340
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Bit by bit. Kill by kill.</i></font>

341
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,688
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And very, very fucking quickly became
one of Minegishi's closest advisers.</i></font>

342
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,027
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And those loyal to him said:</i></font>

343
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:05,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Hold your horses.
This geezer ain't the full ticket.</i></font>

344
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He ain't to be trusted."</i></font>

345
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"He's dangerous," they said.</i></font>

346
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"A modern plague," they said.</i></font>

347
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"A White Death."</i></font>

348
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So, sure enough, they were right.</i></font>

349
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He made his own alliance.</i></font>

350
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,172
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>His own gang.</i></font>

351
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,726
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And what'd he do?</i></font>

352
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stabbed him in the back.</font>

353
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, metaphorically.
He blew his fucking brains out, didn't he?</font>

354
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He wiped the name Minegishi off
the face of the earth in one single night.</i></font>

355
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And made an empire
worthy of the White Death.</i></font>

356
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let me put this bluntly.</font>

357
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's this soulless psychotic leader</font>

358
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,421
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the largest criminal organization
on the planet</font>

359
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">shoved right inside
our fucking ass cheeks.</font>

360
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That motherfucker's
definitely Diesel, then, isn't he?</font>

361
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,098
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you mention Thomas the Tank Engine
one more time</font>

362
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face.
- Okay, if he's such a badass,</font>

363
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:23,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how come he hired two random operators
instead of getting his son back himself?</font>

364
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you actually read the briefings
you'd know that he had a wife.</font>

365
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, he had a wife?</font>

366
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was the most important
fucking thing in his life, and she died.</font>

367
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drunk driving accident or some shit.</font>

368
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now he's at the compound.
He ain't left since.</font>

369
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An unnamed locomotive
might say there's a lesson to be learned.</font>

370
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:40,125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he didn't hire
two random operators, Lemon.</font>

371
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he asked for the best.</font>

372
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.</font>

373
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked for pros who wouldn't fuck up.</font>

374
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 words, Lemon.</font>

375
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are...
- Fucked.</font>

376
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,855
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

377
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People think
that I'm just some young girl.</font>

378
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone's future wife...</font>

379
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or future mother.</font>

380
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm not in someone else's story.</font>

381
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're all in mine.</font>

382
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck does that have to do with me?</font>

383
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You work for the most feared boss
in the city: The White Death.</font>

384
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,212
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, deny it all you want.</font>

385
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you work for someone who works
for someone else, et cetera, et cetera,</font>

386
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it all falls under the same person.</font>

387
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You delivered a briefcase 2 days ago</font>

388
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to one of the White Death's associates,</i></font>

389

what you think I can do for you.</font>

392
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,984

00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope.</font>

656
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay. I was kidding.</font>

657
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, yeah, what's up?
What do you need, bro?</font>

658
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, game's up, big boy.</font>

659
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where is the case?</font>

660
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me, and I promise
I'll only shoot you enough...</font>

661
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, um, is this the sex stuff?</font>

662
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Twat!</font>

663
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,512

00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Picture what?</font>

668
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, the man. Watching your son.</font>

669
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I wonder how he'll do it.</i></font>

670
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe a pillow to the face.</font>

671
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,413
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or maybe something clever.</font>

672
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,173
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like an air bubble in the IV.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. You hold onto it.</font>

674
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far</font>

679
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,983
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be honest.</font>

680
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's there with you?</font>

681
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found out who pushed Wataru
off that roof.</font>

682
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:40,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you go to the authorities?</font>

683
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanted to handle it myself.</font>

684
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son.</font>

685
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:51,260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't control
What fate has in store for us.</font>

686

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father.</font>

687
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

688
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not finished.</font>

689
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:02,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're going to sit here and you're going
to go through every combination</font>

690
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,652
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until you open up that case.</font>

Just a thought.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There he is.
- He got by me.</font>

695

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah, me, too.</font>

696
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess our best option now</font>

697
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:39,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is, uh, bring the White Death
the man who killed his son.</font>

He's not the type, mate.</font>

- You or me?</font>

00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:56,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, that asshole stole my phone.</font>

705
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,242

706
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, come on.
- That's my favorite gun. Son of a bitch.</font>

707

complete waste of our t...</font>

713
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, all right. We just have
to prove we have a case we don't have</font>

I'm a professional.</font>

719

some Yakuza trap, but clearly not.</font>

don't come a-knockin', right?</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Have you tried
these smart toilets?</font>

762

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

767
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,161

<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm hedging my bets, you could say.</font>

775

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

blown up in my hand at any point.</font>

920
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

921
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:39,463
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about a silver case with a train
sticker by the handle? You seen that?</font>

922
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not ringing any...</font>

923
01:02:41,341 --> 01:02:44,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Kimura, have you seen
a silver briefcase with the train...</font>

924
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you say
"train sticker by the handle"?</font>

925
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The handle had a train sticker.
- That's unique.</font>

926
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I haven't seen anything like that.
I think I'd remember.</font>

927
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:52,935
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm.</font>

928
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,097
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Uncle Kimura"?</font>

929
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:58,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Right. Are you okay? That's...</font>

930
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.</font>

931
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:05,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, couldn't hurt to ask, you know?
I'm just gonna keep following him.</font>

932
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,106
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pardon me, "Uncle Kimura."</font>

933
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys take care.</font>

934
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one thing, though, uh...</font>

935
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most people assume "suitcase,"
you know, 'cause it's a train,</font>

936
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,623
<font face="Comic Sans MS">overnight and all.</font>

937
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you...</font>

938
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said "briefcase."</font>

939
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said "briefcase."</font>

940
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,668
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think...</font>

941
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,588
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found my Diesel.</font>

942
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.
- Mm-hm.</font>

943
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:39,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We should just get off this train. Now.</font>

944
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:42,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think I'm stepping off this train
without Lemon or the case,</font>

945
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you must be mistaken.</font>

946
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Well, the case is
in the first-class lounge.</font>

947
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,148
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's behind the bar.
It's in a trash can. It's yours.</font>

948
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,028
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, I'm getting off.</font>

949
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna go find a temple
and reevaluate my choices or something.</font>

950
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ooh, that sounds very lovely,
but here's the deal.</font>

951
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still need a fall guy.</font>

952
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

953
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You need a fall guy.
- Yeah.</font>

954
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:04,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I understand. I get it.</font>

955
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a bit of a conundrum,
'cause I'm thinking,</font>

956
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Do I hand him back in one piece"</font>

957
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:13,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or do I chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you inside a fucking Momomon.</font>

958
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what's
going through my head right now.</font>

959
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hm.</font>

960
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:18,643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or...</font>

961
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or what? You got a better idea, do ya?</font>

962
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, before us now is just a wall,</font>

963
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,733
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's an illusion, man,
it's a construct.</font>

964
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know,
'cause within that wall sits a window.</font>

965
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A window of opportunity.</font>

966
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:31,819
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it. It's a door.</font>

967
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Within that wall is a door.</font>

968
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:37,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm finding it very hard
to follow this story.</font>

969
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My point is, that door is closing.</font>

970
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now the only question is:</font>

971
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which one is the Diesel,
which one is the Duck?</font>

972
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Duck"?</font>

973
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,012
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a kid's show.
<i>Thomas the Train Engine.</i></font>

974
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close. <i>Thomas the Tank Engine.</i></font>

975
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:04,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, mister.</font>

976
01:05:05,485 --> 01:05:07,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This man, he kidnapped me,</font>

977
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:10,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he said that he's going
to hold me for ransom.</font>

978
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
I get captivated by white-girl tears.</font>

979
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,701
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bravo.</font>

980
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:20,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Common sense tells me that this old,
shaky geezer here is the one in charge,</font>

981
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm really good at reading people</font>

982
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and something tells me
that you are just not fucking right.</font>

983
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:31,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So... let's see here.
I mean, I can't shoot you both.</font>

984
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:34,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I get no answers.</font>

985
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:39,095
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about this? I'm sure you'll love this.
We're gonna play a little game.</font>

986
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you wanna play a game,
put both your hands up.</font>

987
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perfect. I knew you would like this.</font>

988
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,186
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna close your eyes,
and I'm gonna count to 3.</font>

989
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whichever one is in charge,
raise your hand.</font>

990
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whichever one isn't,
you point at the one who is.</font>

991
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,</font>

992
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're both liars,
and the truth ain't in ya.</font>

993
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,859
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I'll fucking shoot you both.
Ready?</font>

994
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said you couldn't kill us both.
You'd get no answers.</font>

995
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I did say that. Didn't I?
- Yes.</font>

996
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you gotta shoot first
and come up with answers later.</font>

997
01:06:07,005 --> 01:06:08,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One.</font>

998
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Or if I don't answer
this phone when you call...</i></font>

999
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 2. 3.
- <i>kill Wataru.</i></font>

1000
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I dreaming?</font>

1001
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:14,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, mate. Not your lucky day.</font>

1002
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a wire in my bag,</font>

1003
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:27,367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I think that we could use it
to lock the door from the outside.</font>

1004
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was so scary.</font>

1005
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:34,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I yelled or anything,</font>

1006
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he would do
awful, awful things to me.</font>

1007
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then why didn't you use this, then?</font>

1008
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:46,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he kidnapped ya
and, uh, gave you his gun to hold, right?</font>

1009
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:48,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, no, no. Um...
- Easy.</font>

1010
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. I don't know how to use a gun.
I don't know. Please.</font>

1011
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:53,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck me. You are fucking...</font>

1012
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are really good.
You sure you didn't study?</font>

1013
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,105
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not even afraid
and your lip's quivering.</font>

1014
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a tear.
That is really authentic, mate.</font>

1015
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:01,868
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the Diesel.</font>

1016
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,985
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I gotta kill ya.
- Please.</font>

1017
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a kid. Please.</font>

1018
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:08,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you do that?!
It's really unbelievable!</font>

1019
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:09,457
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please. Please.</font>

1020
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,219
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got, uh...</font>

1021
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,508
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's fucking... You stay right there.</font>

1022
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you...? What the fuck is happening?</font>

1023
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone loves lemons.</font>

1024
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:39,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking die!</font>

1025
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad you enjoyed the performance.</font>

1026
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do that?</font>

1027
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not sure.</font>

1028
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just lucky, I guess.</font>

1029
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell Tangerine... Tell Tangerine...</font>

1030
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:09,642

1032
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tangerine is Gordon.</font>

1033
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Getting off this train.
I'm getting that case, and that's it.</font>

on the bullet train.</font>

1037
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can pick it up

<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was right.</font>

1182
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's been Diesel</font>

1183
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:10,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">running up and down this train,
causing all sorts of fucking havoc.</font>

1184
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:14,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it was you the whole fucking time,
you dirty little Diesel!</font>

1185
01:20:18,689 --> 01:20:20,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You made Lemon bleed...</font>

1186
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,856
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Lemon never bleeds.</font>

1187
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:25,939
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Mister, please help me!</font>

1188
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please! Please help me! Please!</font>

1189
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck are you doing,
you bellend!</font>

1190
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:42,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh...</font>

1191
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:49,253
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1192
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,345
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Diesel!</font>

1193
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:51,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1194
01:20:51,722 --> 01:20:53,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucking bellend!</font>

1195
01:20:58,187 --> 01:20:59,348
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're Diesel.</font>

1196
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:02,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1197
01:21:04,401 --> 01:21:06,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Um...
- What the fuck?</font>

1198
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:10,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said that he was going to kill you
and blame everything on you.</font>

1199
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:16,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He also said that there's someone
waiting for us at Kyoto Station.</font>

1200
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone scary, who would hurt me.</font>

1201
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,541
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's gonna hurt you.</font>

1202
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:24,459
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1203
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're getting off this train.</font>

1204
01:21:35,474 --> 01:21:37,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We make the next stop, we'll be fine.</font>

1205
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, kid, come
0... Kid, come on!</font>

1206
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't, my backpack is stuck!</font>

1207
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1208
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:05,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave it, let's go.</font>

1209
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:07,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We gotta go, we gotta go.
- No, I can't!</font>

1210
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now, young lady!</font>

1211
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- It's our last chance!</font>

1212
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:12,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please come back!</font>

1213
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kid, please.</font>

1214
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:16,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm scared,
I don't want to be alone, please!</font>

1215
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:23,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

1216
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not your fault, kid.</font>

1217
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my luck, not yours.</font>

1218
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got your whole life ahead of you.</font>

1219
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:36,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make sure you do something
that brings you peace.</font>

1220
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause everything else
is a pain in the ass.</font>

1221
01:22:40,414 --> 01:22:43,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you run into a guy named Carver,
he's a dick.</font>

1222
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell him I said so.</font>

1223
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:48,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Um...</font>

1224
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,466
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I, uh...</font>

1225
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took this. I didn't want to leave it.</font>

1226
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:58,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man had it,
and I thought you could probably use it</font>

1227
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:01,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to kill whoever's waiting
for us at the end of the line.</font>

1228
01:23:02,436 --> 01:23:04,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going to let me get hurt.</font>

1229
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:05,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be honest.</font>

1230
01:23:07,316 --> 01:23:08,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be honest.</font>

1231
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's there with you?</font>

1232
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:16,824
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

1233
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:18,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Uh...</font>

1234
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, fella, you're creepin' me out.</font>

1235
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:25,782
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if you don't mind,
could you just find another seat, like,</font>

1236
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:29,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">way, way, way down there?</font>

1237
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:33,210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that way,
I won't have to tell you twice.</font>

1238
01:23:33,967 --> 01:23:34,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1239
01:23:35,636 --> 01:23:36,842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't.</font>

1240
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:44,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just move.
Let me grab your bag.</font>

1241
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:47,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow.</font>

1242
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that a snake?</font>

1243
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:01,025
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you know where my son is?</font>

1244
01:24:04,831 --> 01:24:07,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ow! Ow! Ow!</font>

1245
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, fuck.</font>

1246
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1247
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:36,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After everything.</font>

1248
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are the person</font>

1249
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:48,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who pushed my grandson
off the department store roof.</font>

1250
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1251
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your son.</font>

1252
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:55,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was going to help me
kill the White Death at Kyoto Station.</font>

1253
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that was the only way
to get him on this train.</font>

1254
01:25:02,472 --> 01:25:03,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The White Death.</font>

1255
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

1256
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he couldn't even do that.</font>

1257
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:10,605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So he's dead.</font>

1258
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a few cars back.</font>

1259
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:14,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They are both dead.</font>

1260
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:25,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandson was pushed off a roof.</font>

1261
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:29,743
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you think
I would leave him unprotected?</font>

1262
01:25:53,523 --> 01:25:55,730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My grandson is safe.</font>

1263
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my son is not dead.</font>

1264
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:01,646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, old man...</font>

1265
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only thing you know
about an old man, young lady,</font>

1266
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:07,660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that he has survived much more,</font>

1267
01:26:07,746 --> 01:26:11,364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and much worse, than you.</font>

1268
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:22,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll fucking kill him myself.</font>

1269
01:26:31,812 --> 01:26:33,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you all right?
- From that?</font>

1270
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:37,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna believe
this coincidence</font>

1271
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:42,103
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I already got a dose of antivenom
in me today, so I'm good.</font>

1272
01:26:43,407 --> 01:26:44,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Probably.</font>

1273
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:47,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The girl...</font>

1274
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:50,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her intentions with you
were not honorable.</font>

1275
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:52,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1276
01:26:52,666 --> 01:26:56,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A blind man could see
you are the one in the dark.</font>

1277
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:58,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about a blind man.
She was pretty convincing.</font>

1278
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:02,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What did you do to her?
- I did not need to do anything.</font>

1279
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:06,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fate will do what it wills.</font>

1280
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:10,805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you laugh at fate?</font>

1281
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:17,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, fate for me
is just another word for bad luck.</font>

1282
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:22,769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that follows me around like...</font>

1283
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:26,981
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, something witty.</font>

1284
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:32,619
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My handler calls me Ladybug.</font>

1285
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:34,613
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's witty.</font>

1286
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:36,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladybug?</font>

1287
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:36,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1288
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is very lucky, indeed.</font>

1289
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, she's being ironic, she...</font>

1290
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ah, never mind.</font>

1291
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to tell you a story now.</font>

1292
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I'm good.
- It's short.</font>

1293
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:50,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really, I'm fine.</font>

1294
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:52,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's very quick.</font>

1295
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

1296
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a good story for you, I think.</font>

1297
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm cool.</font>

1298
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

1299
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:02,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A long time ago,</font>

1300
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a promise to myself</font>

1301
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:11,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>that I would provide for my family
no matter what it cost.</i></font>

1302
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:20,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I had risen to a highly coveted position
within the Minegishi crime family.</i></font>

1303
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A man raised up to take my place.</font>

1304
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:24,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A man from the North.</i></font>

1305
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:34,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I asked Minegishi not to trust this man.</i></font>

1306
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:39,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Minegishi told me I had lost my appetite.</i></font>

1307
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:40,648
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He was not wrong.</i></font>

1308
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But neither was I.</i></font>

1309
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I returned home</i></font>

1310
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:11,969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and found nothing except ash and blood.</font>

1311
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The White Death
had taken everything from me.</i></font>

1312
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:35,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Almost.</font>

1313
01:29:37,914 --> 01:29:39,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yuichi!</font>

1314
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yuichi.</font>

1315
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,418

01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,137
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I got a bad feeling about this.
We have no idea what's in this case.</font>

1452
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talkin' about?</font>

1453
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:27,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is it always gotta be us
that opens this shit?</font>

1454
01:40:27,897 --> 01:40:29,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just open the goddamn case.</font>

1455

01:40:48,834 --> 01:40:51,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, very astute.</font>

1462

You can stop the train.</font>

1544
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:55,190
